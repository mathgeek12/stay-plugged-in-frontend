##Getting Started

_As this is a mvp with minimal resources and a strict timeline I chose to use a component library with a template, this is not production ready, to use a template properly I would use the component library and the design, but refactor the code and ONLY keep what is needed, due to time limitations I kept the extraneous code, and only cleaned up the component(s) I used._

```
npm install --force 
npm run start
```
